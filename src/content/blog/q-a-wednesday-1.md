## Q&A WEDNESDAY: Flickering Lights, Can We Fix It (No You Shouldn't), and GFC-what?ðŸ’¡
### âš¡Why Do My Lights Flicker Sometimes? âš¡
Flickering lights can happen for several reasons, like loose wires, a faulty switch, or a bad bulb. It might also be caused by voltage changes from big appliances or problems with the power supply. In some cases, it could be an issue in your electrical panel or circuit. Itâ€™s a good idea to have an electrician check it out to make sure everything is working safely and properly.
### âš¡Can I "DIY" an Electrical Project? âš¡
Itâ€™s better not to DIY electrical work unless you're experienced. Any type of electrical work can be dangerous, and if something goes wrong, it could cause a fire, injury, or worse. It's safer to hire a professional to make sure the job is done correctly and safely.
### âš¡What is a GFCI Outlet? âš¡
A GFCI (Ground fault circuit interrupter) is a special outlet used in places/rooms that could potentially have more dampness/moisture in the area. A GFCI is a device that helps protect people from dangerous electrical shocks if thereâ€™s a problem with the electrical current.
