        Quality Electric of Indiana LLC came about by a common and endlessly-frustrating problem - getting good electrical help. <br/>

        And with a real estate development company finding rapid success and a roofing company that could cover them almost as quickly as they were built, the owner of Quality brands had a lightbulb moment: add a new company and do things differently. <br/>
        
        This simple strategy has worked. By putting craftsmanship and kindness over cut-corner tactics, Quality Electric has grown a loyal customer base since 2022 and would love to have your business as well.
